# **Contest-Hub** 💻

[cite_start]Contest-Hub is a unified platform revolutionizing the competitive programming landscape by centralizing coding contests from various platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank into a single, comprehensive hub[cite: 1, 2, 13, 15]. [cite_start]The project's vision is to become the "Duolingo + LinkedIn for Coders," addressing the fragmented ecosystem that currently exists[cite: 90, 11].

## **The Problem** 😩

[cite_start]The current process for discovering and tracking competitive programming contests is broken[cite: 4]. [cite_start]Coders waste significant time, often checking 5-7 different websites to find contests[cite: 5, 6]. [cite_start]This inefficiency leads to a high rate of missed opportunities, with an estimated 30-50% of coders missing contests due to poor visibility[cite: 7, 8]. [cite_start]Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified system for performance tracking, personalized recommendations, and a way to translate coding achievements into career-building assets[cite: 9, 10, 12].

## **Our Solution** ✨

Contest-Hub provides a seamless experience by offering a suite of core features designed to drive engagement and retention:

* [cite_start]**Aggregated Contests:** We consolidate contests from major platforms, providing a single source for all events[cite: 14, 15].
* [cite_start]**Personalized Reminders:** Users receive calendar-based reminders and AI-driven suggestions for upcoming contests, ensuring they never miss an opportunity[cite: 16, 17].
* [cite_start]**Analytics Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard tracks key metrics like solve rates and rankings, giving users a clear view of their performance[cite: 56, 57].
* [cite_start]**Resume Builder:** The platform automatically generates a resume based on a coder's performance, with the ability to auto-export to LinkedIn, directly addressing the career-focused motivations of our users[cite: 18, 19, 58, 59].
* [cite_start]**Gamification:** Features such as badges and leaderboards drive user engagement and are projected to reduce churn by 40%[cite: 20, 21, 50, 52, 53].

## **Market Opportunity** 📈

[cite_start]The market for this solution is substantial and growing[cite: 22]. [cite_start]The global computer science talent pool is massive, with over 4 crore (40 million) graduates worldwide and 6-8 lakh (600,000-800,000) Indian CS graduates annually[cite: 24, 25, 27]. [cite_start]The worldwide competitive programmer population is estimated to be between 100-150 lakh (1-1.5 crore)[cite: 28].

[cite_start]We are building for three primary segments[cite: 36]:

* [cite_start]**CS Undergraduates** (~30 lakh+): Motivated by building their resumes and securing internships[cite: 39, 40, 41].
* [cite_start]**Competitive Programmers** (~100–150 lakh): Focused on skill-building and improving their rankings[cite: 42, 43, 44].
* [cite_start]**Early Professionals** (~10 lakh): Looking for successful career transitions[cite: 45, 46, 47].

[cite_start]The Edtech market is also a significant opportunity, with a projected value of ₹33,600 crore by 2025 in India, growing at a 16% CAGR[cite: 29, 30, 31]. [cite_start]Resume-focused learning and AI/ML are key drivers of this growth[cite: 32, 33, 34].

## **Business & Growth Strategy** 🚀

[cite_start]Our revenue strategy is both scalable and diversified[cite: 62]. We will generate income through:

* [cite_start]**Premium Subscriptions:** A subscription model priced at ₹75–₹100/month[cite: 63, 64].
* [cite_start]**Affiliate Commissions:** Earning 15-20% from partnerships with online course providers[cite: 65, 66].
* [cite_start]**Ad Revenue:** Monetizing free users with a CPM of ₹400–800[cite: 67, 68].

[cite_start]Looking ahead, we plan to expand with sponsored contests, mentorship programs, and video content[cite: 69, 70].

### **Roadmap & Milestones** 🗓️

* [cite_start]**Current Milestones:** Platform prototype is complete, with over 100 beta testers onboard and a functional scraper for 5 platforms[cite: 73, 74, 75].
* [cite_start]**Q1 2026:** Launch of the web platform with core features[cite: 77, 78].
* [cite_start]**Q2 2026:** Release of Android and iOS apps, along with expansion of the contest scraper to include more platforms[cite: 79, 80].
* [cite_start]**Q1 2027:** Introduction of paid content and forging global partnerships[cite: 81, 82].
* [cite_start]**2028+:** Scaling to over 20,000 users and integrating advanced AI mentorship features[cite: 83, 84].
