# **Contest-Hub** üíª

Contest-Hub is a unified platform that revolutionizes the competitive programming landscape. It centralizes coding contests from various platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank into a single, comprehensive hub. Our vision is to become the **"Duolingo + LinkedIn for Coders,"** solving the fragmentation that currently plagues the ecosystem.

## **The Problem** üò©

The process for discovering and tracking competitive programming contests is highly inefficient. Coders waste significant time checking multiple websites, which leads to missed opportunities‚Äîan estimated **30-50% of coders miss contests** due to this poor visibility. The lack of a unified system for performance tracking and personalized recommendations further complicates a coder's journey, making it difficult to translate their achievements into tangible career-building assets.
